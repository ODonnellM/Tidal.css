# Tidal.css
A utility-first, component-lite CSS framework.

# Getting Started Is Hard
We know. Nothing is more disheartening that having a great idea for a website, and running face-first into the brick wall that is _styling_ that website. Writing CSS often feels like either a hurdle you have to clear before you can get to the _real_ work, or the irritating last step holding you back from releasing your awesome idea to the world.

# What Does It Mean To Be 'Utility First'?
Tidal has one guiding design principal that supercedes all others: If a component can be broken down into a few generic utility classes, that component shouldn't exist. Tidal is primarily a collection of CSS attributes wrapped inside convenient pre-defined classes. Here's an example:

Rather than lock users into a collection of components they may not even want, Tidal provides functional classes that (usually) only apply _one_ change to an element.

# Generic = Reuseable
Because Tidal is designed utility-first, it can be used in practically _any_ project to quickly and painlessly style your site. Now you can hit the ground running with that Tinder-for-Axolotls webapp the world didn't know it desperately needed.

# Installation
Just drop any/all of Tidal's SCSS files wherever you normally include your stylesheets.
